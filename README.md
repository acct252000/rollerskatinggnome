## What the Gnome Wants

RollerSkatingGnome aims to help skaters find good inline skating trails, with relevant current weather information to plan skates appropriately. 

### Rolling with your Gnomie

The main page displays skates within the bounds of the map.  The map starts out centered in the Dallas, TX area home of the [Pegasus Flyers](www.pegasusflyers.org).  The map can be recentered through the middle input on the top control bar.  Current weather information, including wind speed, is displayed in the info window for each skate, which can be viewed by clicking on the marker.  

The top left filter allows for searching skates among those displayed, the top right filter allows for searching among all skates in the database.

Suggest a new skate by clicking "Suggest a New Skate!" on the bottom of the left menu bar and submitted the form.  The gnome will review your submission for appropriateness.  Please do not submit anything the gnome does not want to see, the gnome only likes inline skating.

To see detail about a trail, click on the trail name in the info marker window on the main map.


### What is Under the Hat

RollerSkatingGnome is a heroku application coded in php and javascript, using both the [Bootstrap](www.getbootstrap.com) and [Knockout](www.knockoutjs.com) Framework.

### To Dos
Coming soon are a rating system for each trail, as well as comment functionality, so all my gnomies out there can let us know about trail constructions, water hazards, lose packs of roaming dogs, or the like.
